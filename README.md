# Coding Assessment

## Description
In this challenge, I created a coding assessment using JavaScript, for loops, event listeners, and local storage to save the user's score. First, I created an HTML file with a form for the questions and buttons to submit the answers. I then used JavaScript to create an array of objects with the questions, answer choices, and correct answers. I used a for loop to iterate over the array and display the questions and answer choices on the page. I added event listeners to the submit buttons to check the answers and update the score. Finally, I used local storage to save the user's score so they can see their progress on future visits.
